 AboutMeText: Currently studying towards a Master in Computer Science. In my free time I like to climb, play squash or go out for a run. Building puzzles is also a hobby of mine, but I sadly don't have enough time for that currently. I also have multiple code projects that I try to finish (sometime I will finish them all...). At the moment I am working on converting an old website about the periodic system to React. Also planning to add more advanced functions like filtering elements by category and more.
